# Memory-hierarchy-Assembly-Project
The memory hierarchy: The basic requirements for the project assume a simplified read-only one-level caching system that uses direct mapping. The underlying memory address space is assumed to be a 24-bit byte-addressable memory (4 MB). Accessing the memory is assumed to take 120 clock cycles.
